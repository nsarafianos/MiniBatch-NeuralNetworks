# MiniBatch-NeuralNetworks
Building a Neural Network using mini batch propagation

Run the demo to check the results on the fisheriris dataset. 

The implementation is based on the respective chapter of the Pattern Classification book of Duda, Hart and Stork. 

You can select your own parameters and the structure of the Neural Network (Number of hidden layers and hidden units in each layer)
